Hurricanes Irma and Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico at a time when its **infrastructure and emergency systems** lagged behind those elsewhere in the rest of the Caribbean and the United States. The impoverishment of the island is nothing new, though the storm has certainly aggravated the state of poverty, pushing 100% of the island’s power grid past its breaking point and causing additional damage to neglected structures and infrastructures. In part due to Puerto Rico’s unpayable debt circumstances, many financial institutions have chosen to foreclose damaged properties in hopes of turning a profit as developers eye the region, slowing recovery. Migration due to the aforementioned factors of debt and land disenfranchisement have impeded recovery efforts, furthering the push of inhabitants off the island as structures go unrepaired. At 9.8%, Puerto Rico has an unemployment rate that more than doubles the current national unemployment rate (*United States Department of Labor, n.d.*), and legally unrestricted migration to the United States further encourages inhabitants to leave. An estimated 140,000 residents have left in the past year (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018), though some place that estimate significantly higher.


Puerto Rico’s existing crisis, further intensified by the damage left behind by the storms, have led many opportunistic speculators to eye the island as a tabula rasa with an undetermined future. As such, we believe it is crucial to study what life may look like for the residents of Puerto Rico under these potential changes.
